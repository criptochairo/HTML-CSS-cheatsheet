            <h2><br><br>Summary</h2>
            <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content 
                on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version 
                that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current 
                specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by 
                the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a 
                consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and 
                Microsoft). </p>

            <h2><br><br>HTML Tags</h2>
            <p>HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will 
                format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can 
                distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags 
                contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But 
                some HTML tags are unclosed tags.<br><br>

                When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top 
                to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents 
                and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.<br><br>
                
                An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can 
                differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many 
                tags you want as per your code requirement.</p>

            <h2><br><br>Semantic HTML</h2>
            <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser 
                and the developer.<br><br>

                Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing 
                about its content.<br><br>
                
                Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article - 
                Clearly defines its content.</p>
            
            <p>The most common semantic elements are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>article</li>
                <li>aside</li>
                <li>details</li>
                <li>figcaption</li>
                <li>figure</li>
                <li>footer</li>
                <li>header</li>
                <li>main</li>
                <li>mark</li>
                <li>nav</li>
                <li>section</li>
                <li>summary</li>
                <li>time</li>

            <h2>Common attributes</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.<br><br>

            CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.<br><br>

            From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification</p>

            <p>Some of the most common attributes within CSS include background, border, color, margin, float and font.</p>

              <p>In order to learn more about these attributes, one can check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference">this article.</a></p>

            <h2>Semantic CSS</h2>
            <p>Semantic HTML isn't only about the elements we use. It's quite obvious that we should use a for links, table for tabular data and p for paragraphs etc. What's less obvious is the names we use for classes.<br><br>

            As Phil Karton says, “there are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” So spending a whole chapter talking about naming is essential.<br><br>
            
            Non-semantic classes don't convey what an element represents. At most they give you an idea of what an element looks like. Atomic, visual, behavioural and utility classes are all forms of non-semantic classes.

            Semantic classes don't convey their styles, but that's fine—that's what CSS is for. Semantic classes mean something to HTML, CSS, Javascript and automated functional tests.</p>

            <h2>Useful resources</h2>
            <p>
              There are many useful tools out there to use CSS, some of which I have compiled and put in a list here: 
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://cssgradient.io/">CSS Gradient</a> is an excellent tool for visualizing and generating backgrounds in CSS. The main advantage I find is that it writes the rgb values for you, so you don't have to spend half an hour looking for the right ones.<br><br></li>
                <li><a target="_blank" href="https://rgbacolorpicker.com/"> RGBA color picker</a> helps you know the values for an rgba function, which allows you to do gradients in CSS, which is pretty neat.<br><br></li>
                <li>Finally, this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rgbtohex.net/">RGB to HEX</a> converter can get you out of a bind if the function you're trying to use only accepts hex and all you have is some shitty rgba, like, who wants that anyway. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <footer>
              <p>This post was made by the hex gang.</p>
